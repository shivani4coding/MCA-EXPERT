<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
<p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.

Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. <br>

AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.
</p>

<h2>Goals of AI</h2>
<p>To Create Expert Systems - The systems which exhibit intelligent behavior, learn, demonstrate, explain, and advice its users. <br>

To Implement Human Intelligence in Machines - Creating systems that understand, think, learn, and behave like humans.
</p>

<h2>What is AI Technique?</h2>
In the real world, the knowledge has some unwelcomed properties - <br>

Its volume is huge, next to unimaginable. <br>
It is not well-organized or well-formatted. <br>
It keeps changing constantly. <br>


<h3>AI Technique is a manner to organize and use the knowledge efficiently in such a way that -</h3>

It should be perceivable by the people who provide it. <br>
It should be easily modifiable to correct errors. <br>
It should be useful in many situations though it is incomplete or inaccurate. <br>
AI techniques elevate the speed of execution of the complex program it is equipped with. <br>

<h2>Applications of AI</h2>
AI has been dominant in various fields such as - <br>

Gaming - AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge. <br>

Natural Language Processing - It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans. <br>

Expert Systems - There are some applications which integrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users. <br>

Vision Systems - These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. 
<h3>For example</h3> - A spying aeroplane takes photographs, which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist. <br>

Speech Recognition - Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to cold, etc. <br>

Handwriting Recognition - The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text. <br>

Intelligent Robots - Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment. <br>

<h2>What is Intelligence?</h2>
The ability of a system to calculate, reason, perceive relationships and analogies, learn from experience, store and retrieve information from memory, solve problems, comprehend complex ideas, use natural language fluently, classify, generalize, and adapt new situations. <br>

<h2>What is Intelligence Composed of?</h2>
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of -  <br>

Reasoning <br>
Learning <br>
Problem Solving <br>
Perception <br>
Linguistic Intelligence <br>

<h2>Difference between Human and Machine Intelligence</h2>
Humans perceive by patterns whereas the machines perceive by set of rules and data. <br>

Humans store and recall information by patterns, machines do it by searching algorithms. For example, the number 40404040 is easy to remember, store, and recall as its pattern is simple.  <br>

Humans can figure out the complete object even if some part of it is missing or distorted; whereas the machines cannot do it correctly. <br>

<h2>What are Agent and Environment?</h2>

An agent is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through effectors. <br>

A human agent has sensory organs such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin parallel to the sensors, and other organs such as hands, legs, mouth, for effectors. <br>

A robotic agent replaces cameras and infrared range finders for the sensors, and various motors and actuators for effectors. <br>

A software agent has encoded bit strings as its programs and actions
