<h2>Professional Ethics</h2>
<p>Rajat and Meera are colleagues working in the same company. They are also in the same team and are working on the same project. One day, Meera confides in Rajat that she is going to quit the company after two months. <br>

Rajat tried to persuade her not to take such kind of decision in haste, but from Meera’s determination, he realized soon that she has already made up her mind. She requests him to not share this with anybody else as she hasn’t mentioned it to anyone but him, and Rajat promised he won’t. <br>

A 12th-century Byzantine manuscript of the Hippocratic oath. <br>
Professional ethics encompass the personal, organizational, and corporate standards of behavior expected by professionals.
The term professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By at least the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: Divinity, Law, and Medicine. The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time. <br>
Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics. <br>
Professionals are capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.[4] One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the Hippocratic oath to which medical doctors still adhere to this day.

 <h2>Legal vs. Ethical</h2>

<p>Many people confuse ‘ethical’ with ‘legal’. Legal is the word used to define anything that concerns the law or its workings. It is applicable to all practices, languages, processes, procedures, cultures, and other relative concepts in a system of the law. On the other hand, ethics is the word used to define the traditional norms and morals of an individual. <br>

Many of the existing laws have originated from ethics while ethics is rooted in morals and the perception of the rightness or wrongness of an act or conduct. <br>

Any legal act is applicable to all people in a State that implements a particular set of laws. On the other hand, ethics is society specific. Two different societies located in a similar geo-political region definitely have one rule of law, but they may have two different ethics. For example, in India, there is one law applicable to every citizen, but possibly there are several ethics applicable to concerned society only. <br>

However, both the terms – legal and ethical – are spatio-temporal and change with time and space. For example, there was a time when slavery was legally justified
</p>

<h2>Rights of an Employee</h2>
 
<p>Employees are an asset to the company and any ethical organization would like its employees to be happy and prosperous by providing them a safe and happy working environment, steady work, reasonable modifications to work time, and a healthy work-life balance. <br>

Many companies that top the chart when it comes to providing ideal environments to its employees credit their good employee management and retention programs as the key to their success.</p>

<h2>Professional Ethics For Employers</h2>
 
<p>Companies have also started encouraging the cultivation and practice of good ethics on their workplaces by providing fair assessments to their employees, and sharing power and responsibility with them. There is a transparency in the way work responsibility is shared and how work is delegated. A lot of importance is given to clear communication, with exact instructions. <br>

Companies periodically conduct trainings to enhance employees’ knowledge and aptitude towards work. Sharing constructive feedback with employees and inviting their feedback are important steps that encourage an employee to think of the organization as a collective unit where teams are allotted specific responsibilities.</p>
