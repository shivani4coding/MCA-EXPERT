       			<h2 class="btn-success">Software Project Management</h2>

<p>A project is well-defined task, which is a collection of several operations done in order to achieve a goal 
for example, software development and delivery. <br>
A Project can be characterized as: <br>


1.Project is not routine activity or day-to-day operations.<br>
2.Project comes with a start time and end time.<br>
3.Project ends when its goal is achieved hence it is a temporary phase in the lifetime of an organization.<br>
4.Project needs adequate resources in terms of time, manpower, finance, material and knowledge-bank.<br>
5.Every project may has a unique and distinct goal. <br>
<h2>Software Project</h2>
        A Software Project is the complete procedure of software development from requirement gathering to testing and maintenance, carried out according to the execution methodologies, in a specified period of time to achieve intended software product.</p>

		<h2>Need of software project management</h2>

Software is said to be an intangible product. Software development is a kind of all new stream in world business and there’s very little experience in building software products. Most software products are tailor made to fit client’s requirements. The most important is that the underlying technology changes and advances so frequently and rapidly that experience of one product may not be applied to the other one. All such business and environmental constraints bring risk in software development hence it is essential to manage software projects efficiently.

	    <h2>Time_Cost_Quality</h2>
The image above shows triple constraints for software projects. It is an essential part of software organization to deliver quality product, keeping the cost within client’s budget constrain and deliver the project as per scheduled. There are several factors, both internal and external, which may impact this triple constrain triangle. Any of three factor can severely impact the other two.

			<h2>Software Project Manager</h2>
A software project manager is a person who undertakes the responsibility of executing the software project. Software project manager is thoroughly aware of all the phases of SDLC that the software would go through. Project manager may never directly involve in producing the end product but he controls and manages the activities involved in production.A project manager closely monitors the development process, prepares and executes various plans, arranges necessary and adequate resources, maintains communication among all team members in order to address issues of cost, budget, resources, time, quality and customer satisfaction. <br>

1.Managing People <br>
2.Act as project leader <br>
3.Liaison with stakeholders <br>

<h2>Software Management Activities</h2>
Software project management comprises of a number of activities, which contains planning of project, deciding scope of software product, estimation of cost in various terms, scheduling of tasks and events, and resource management. Project management activities may include: <br>

1.Project Planning <br>
2.Scope Management <br>
3.Project Estimation <br>

		<h2>Project Planning</h2>

Software project planning is task, which is performed before the production of software actually starts. It is there for the software production but involves no concrete activity that has any direction connection with software production; rather it is a set of multiple processes, which facilitates software production. Project planning may include the following:

		<h2>Scope Management</h2>

It defines the scope of project; this includes all the activities, process need to be done in order to make a deliverable software product. Scope management is essential because it creates boundaries of the project by clearly defining what would be done in the project and what would not be done. This makes project to contain limited and quantifiable tasks, which can easily be documented and in turn avoids cost and time overrun.



		<h2>Software size estimation</h2>
Software size may be estimated either in terms of KLOC (Kilo Line of Code) or by calculating number of function points in the software. Lines of code depend upon coding practices and Function points vary according to the user or software requirement.

			<h2>Effort estimation</h2>
The managers estimate efforts in terms of personnel requirement and man-hour required to produce the software. For effort estimation software size should be known. This can either be derived by managers’ experience, organization’s historical data or software size can be converted into efforts by using some standard formulae.

				<h2>Time estimation</h2>
Once size and efforts are estimated, the time required to produce the software can be estimated. Efforts required is segregated into sub categories as per the requirement specifications and interdependency of various components of software. Software tasks are divided into smaller tasks, activities or events by Work Breakthrough Structure (WBS). The tasks are scheduled on day-to-day basis or in calendar months.

The sum of time required to complete all tasks in hours or days is the total time invested to complete the project.

		<h2>Cost estimation</h2>
This might be considered as the most difficult of all because it depends on more elements than any of the previous ones. For estimating project cost, it is required to consider - <br>

1.Size of software <br>
2.Software quality <br>
3.Hardware <br>
4.Additional software or tools, licenses etc. <br>

We discussed various parameters involving project estimation such as size, effort, time and cost. <br>

Project manager can estimate the listed factors using two broadly recognized techniques – <br>

<h2>Decomposition Technique</h2>
This technique assumes the software as a product of various compositions. <br>

 <h3>There are two main models -</h3>

1.Line of Code Estimation is done on behalf of number of line of codes in the software product. <br>
2.Function Points Estimation is done on behalf of number of function points in the software product. <br>


			<h2>Project Risk Management</h2>
Risk management involves all activities pertaining to identification, analyzing and making provision for predictable and non-predictable risks in the project. 


			<h2>Risk Management Process</h2>

There are following activities involved in risk management process: <br>

1.Identification - Make note of all possible risks, which may occur in the project. <br>
2.Categorize - Categorize known risks into high, medium and low risk intensity as per their possible impact on the project. <br>
3.Manage - Analyze the probability of occurrence of risks at various phases. Make plan to avoid or face risks. Attempt to minimize their side-effects. <br>
4.Monitor - Closely monitor the potential risks and their early symptoms. Also monitor the effects of steps taken to mitigate or avoid them. <br>


			<h2>Project Execution & Monitoring</h2>

In this phase, the tasks described in project plans are executed according to their schedules.Execution needs monitoring in order to check whether everything is going according to the plan. Monitoring is observing to check the probability of risk and taking measures to address the risk or report the status of various tasks.

		<h3>These measures include -</h3>

1.Activity Monitoring - All activities scheduled within some task can be monitored on day-to-day basis. When all activities in a task are completed, it is considered as complete. <br>
2.Status Reports - The reports contain status of activities and tasks completed within a given time frame, generally a week. Status can be marked as finished, pending or work-in-progress etc. <br>
3.Milestones Checklist - Every project is divided into multiple phases where major tasks are performed (milestones) based on the phases of SDLC. This milestone checklist is prepared once every few weeks and reports the status of milestones. <br>


			<h2>PERT Chart</h2>
PERT (Program Evaluation & Review Technique) chart is a tool that depicts project as network diagram. It is capable of graphically representing main events of project in both parallel and consecutive way.



				<h2>GANTT Chart</h2>
Gantt charts was devised by Henry Gantt (1917). It represents project schedule with respect to time periods. It is a horizontal bar chart with bars representing activities and time scheduled for the project activities.
