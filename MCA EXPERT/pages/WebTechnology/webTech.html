       				<h1> <center>AJAX</center> </h1>

AJAX, is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications.If you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start with AJAX. <br>

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script. <br>

Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display. <br>

Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the server using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server. <br>


AJAX cannot work independently. It is used in combination with other technologies to create interactive webpages. <br>

	<h2>JavaScript</h2>

Loosely typed scripting language.
JavaScript function is called when an event occurs in a page.
Glue for the whole AJAX operation.

			<h2>DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL</h2>

API for accessing and manipulating structured documents.
Represents the structure of XML and HTML documents.

			<h2>CASCADED STYLE SHEET</h2>

Allows for a clear separation of the presentation style from the content and may be changed programmatically by JavaScript.

		<h2>XMLHttpRequest</h2>

JavaScript object that performs asynchronous interaction with the server.

            <h1>
                <center>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</center>
            </h1>

        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999.
Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus the link available on a webpage are called Hypertext.

	<h3>Example of Html-</h3>
<code> <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <body>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   </body>
</html></code>

			<h2>HTML Tags</h2>

<p>As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces <Tag Name>. Except few tags, most of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example <html> has its closing tag </html> and <body> tag has its closing tag </body> tag etc.</p>


		<h2>Heading Tags</h2>

Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements h1 to h6

	<h3>Example of Heading Tags-</h3>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Heading Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
</body>
</html>


		<h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
<p>The tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p>.


		<h3>Bold Text</h3>

Anything that appears within <b>...</b> element, is displayed in bold as shown below:

<h4>Example</h4>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Bold Text Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The following word uses a <b>bold</b> typeface.</p>
</body>
</html>


		<h2>Italic Text</h2>

Anything that appears within <i>...</i> element is displayed in italicized as shown below:

<h4>Example</h4>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Italic Text Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The following word uses a <i>italicized</i> typeface.</p>
</body>
</html>

		<h2>Underlined Text</h2>

Anything that appears within <u>...</u> element, is displayed with underline as shown below:

<h4>Example</h4>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Underlined Text Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The following word uses a <u>underlined</u> typeface.</p>
</body>
</html>

	<h2>Insert Image</h2>

You can insert any image in your web page by using <img> tag. Following is the simple syntax to use this tag. <br>

<img src="Image URL" ... attributes-list/>


  <h4>Example of Image-</h4>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Using Image in Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Simple Image Insert</p>
<img src="/html/images/test.png" alt="Test Image" />
</body>
</html>


		<h2>HTML Tables</h2>

The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the <tr> tag is used to create table rows and <td> tag is used to create data cells.

   <h4>Example of table-</h4>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Tables</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>

		
		

		<h3>Tables Backgrounds</h3>

You can set table background using one of the following two ways: <br>
1.bgcolor attribute - You can set background color for whole table or just for one cell. <br>

2.background attribute - You can set background image for whole table or just for one cell. <br>


<h4>Example of table background-</h4>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Table Background</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1" bordercolor="green" bgcolor="yellow">
<tr>
<th>Column 1</th>
<th>Column 2</th>
<th>Column 3</th>
</tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2">Row 1 Cell 1</td><td>Row 1 Cell 2</td><td>Row 1 Cell 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Row 2 Cell 2</td><td>Row 2 Cell 3</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3">Row 3 Cell 1</td></tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>



			<h2>HTML Lists</h2>


HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain: <br>

1.<ul> - An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets. <br>
2.<ol> - An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items. <br>
3.<dl> - A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary. <br>
 

			<h2>HTML Colors</h2>

Colors are very important to give a good look and feel to your website. You can specify colors on page level using <body> tag or you can set colors for individual tags using bgcolor attribute.The <body> tag has following attributes which can be used to set different colors: <br>

1.bgcolor - sets a color for the background of the page. <br>

2.text - sets a color for the body text. <br>

3.alink - sets a color for active links or selected links. <br>

4.link - sets a color for linked text. <br>

5.vlink - sets a color for visited links - that is, for linked text that you have already clicked on. <br>


			<h2>HTML Marquees</h2>

An HTML marquee is a scrolling piece of text displayed either horizontally across or vertically down your webpage depending on the settings. This is created by using HTML <marquees> tag. <br>

		<h3>Syntax of marquee-</h3>

<marquee attribute_name="attribute_value"....more attributes>One or more lines or text message or image
</marquee>

		<h4>Examples of marquee-</h4>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML marquee Tag</title>
</head>
<body>
<marquee>This is basic example of marquee</marquee>
</body>
</html>

        <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.


		<h3>JavaScript - Syntax</h3>

JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page. <br>

<script ...>
   JavaScript code
</script>


			<h2>JavaScript - Variables</h2>

   <h3>JavaScript Datatypes</h3>

One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language. <br>

JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types - <br>
1.Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc. <br>

2.Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc. <br>

3.Boolean <br>
EXAMPLE- true or false.


		<h2>JavaScript - Operators</h2>

<h3>What is an operator?</h3>

Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript supports the following types of operators. <br>

1.Arithmetic Operators <br>

2.Comparision Operators <br>

3.Logical (or Relational) Operators <br>

4.Assignment Operators <br>

5.Conditional (or ternary) Operators <br>


		<h2>JavaScript - if...else Statement</h2>

JavaScript supports the following forms of if..else statement - <br>

<h3>1.if statement </h3>

	Example of if statement-

<html>
   <body>
      
      <script type="text/javascript">
         <!--
            var age = 20;
         
            if( age > 18 ){
               document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>");
            }
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
   </body>
</html>

<h3>2.if...else statement</h3>

      Example of if...else statement-

if (expression){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

else{
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
}

<h3>3.if...else if... statement.</h3>

       Example of if...else if... statement.

<html>
   <body>
   
      <script type="text/javascript">
         <!--
            var age = 15;
         
            if( age > 18 ){
               document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>");
            }
            
            else{
               document.write("<b>Does not qualify for driving</b>");
            }
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
   </body>
</html>

<h3>4.if...else if... statement</h3>

if (expression 1){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
}

else if (expression 2){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
}

else if (expression 3){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
}

else{
   Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
}



		<h2>JavaScript - The Strings Object</h2>

<p>The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.</p>

    <h4>Syntax of string in javascript-</h4>
	var val = new String(string);

	
		<h2>JavaScript - Document Object Model or DOM</h2>

<p>A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of document content.The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM. The Objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of objects in a Web document.</p>

1.Window object - Top of the hierarchy. It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy. <br>

2.Document object - Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. <br>

3.Form object - Everything enclosed in the <form>...</form> tags sets the form object. <br>

4.Form control elements - The form object contains all the elements defined for that object such as text fields, buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes. <br>

        <h1>EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE [XML]</h1>
        				

<p>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).This tutorial will teach you basics of XML. The tutorial is divided into sections such as XML Basics, Advanced XML and XML tools.</p>

<p>XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data. XML is not going to replace HTML in the near future, but it introduces new possibilities by adopting many successful features of HTML.</p>

There are three important characteristics of XML that make it useful in a variety of systems and solutions: <br>
1.XML is extensible: XML allows you to create your own self-descriptive tags, or language, that suits your application. <br>

2.XML carries the data, does not present it: XML allows you to store the data irrespective of how it will be presented. <br>

3.XML is a public standard: XML was developed by an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is available as an open standard. <br>
