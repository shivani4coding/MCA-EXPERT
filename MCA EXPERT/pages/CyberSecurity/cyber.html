<h2>Cyberspace</h2>

<p>Cyberspace can be defined as an intricate environment that involves interactions between people, software, and services. It is maintained by the worldwide distribution of information and communication technology devices and networks. <br>

With the benefits carried by the technological advancements, the cyberspace today has become a common pool used by citizens, businesses, critical information infrastructure, military and governments in a fashion that makes it hard to induce clear boundaries among these different groups. The cyberspace is anticipated to become even more complex in the upcoming years, with the increase in networks and devices connected to it.</p>

<h2>Cyber security</h2>
Cybersecurity denotes the technologies and procedures intended to safeguard computers, networks, and data from unlawful admittance, weaknesses, and attacks transported through the Internet by cyber delinquents. <br>

ISO 27001 (ISO27001) is the international Cybersecurity Standard that delivers a model for creating, applying, functioning, monitoring, reviewing, preserving, and improving an Information Security Management System. <br>

The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology under the government of India provides a strategy outline called the National Cybersecurity Policy. The purpose of this government body is to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyber-attacks. <br>

<h2>Cybersecurity Policy</h2>
The cybersecurity policy is a developing mission that caters to the entire field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) users and providers. It includes - <br>

Home users <br>
Small, medium, and large Enterprises <br>
Government and non-government entities <br>
It serves as an authority framework that defines and guides the activities associated with the security of cyberspace. It allows all sectors and organizations in designing suitable cybersecurity policies to meet their requirements. The policy provides an outline to effectively protect information, information systems and networks. <br>

It gives an understanding into the Governmentâ€™s approach and strategy for security of cyber space in the country. It also sketches some pointers to allow collaborative working across the public and private sectors to safeguard information and information systems. Therefore, the aim of this policy is to create a cybersecurity framework, which leads to detailed actions and programs to increase the security carriage of cyberspace. <br>

<h2>Cyber Crime</h2>
The Information Technology Act 2000 or any legislation in the Country does not describe or mention the term Cyber Crime. It can be globally considered as the gloomier face of technology. The only difference between a traditional crime and a cyber-crime is that the cyber-crime involves in a crime related to computers.



		<h2>Strategy</h2>


To design and implement a secure cyberspace, some stringent strategies have been put in place. This chapter explains the major strategies employed to ensure cybersecurity, which include the following - <br>

Creating a Secure Cyber Ecosystem <br>
Creating an Assurance Framework <br>
Encouraging Open Standards <br>
Strengthening the Regulatory Framework <br>
Creating Mechanisms for IT Security <br>
Securing E-governance Services <br>
Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure <br>
Strategy 1 - Creating a Secure Cyber Ecosystem <br>
The cyber ecosystem involves a wide range of varied entities like devices (communication technologies and computers), individuals, governments, private organizations, etc., which interact with each other for numerous reasons. <br>

This strategy explores the idea of having a strong and robust cyber-ecosystem where the cyber-devices can work with each other in the future to prevent cyber-attacks, reduce their effectiveness, or find solutions to recover from a cyber-attack. <br>

Such a cyber-ecosystem would have the ability built into its cyber devices to permit secured ways of action to be organized within and among groups of devices. This cyber-ecosystem can be supervised by present monitoring techniques where software products are used to detect and report security weaknesses. <br>

A strong cyber-ecosystem has three symbiotic structures - Automation, Interoperability, and Authentication. <br>

Automation - It eases the implementation of advanced security measures, enhances the swiftness, and optimizes the decision-making processes. <br>

Interoperability - It toughens the collaborative actions, improves awareness, and accelerates the learning procedure. There are three types of interoperability - <br>

Semantic (i.e., shared lexicon based on common understanding) <br>
Technical <br>
Policy - Important in assimilating different contributors into an inclusive cyber-defense structure. <br>
Authentication - It improves the identification and verification technologies that work in order to provide - <br>

Security <br>
Affordability <br>
Ease of use and administration <br>
Scalability <br>
Interoperability <br>

<h3>Intellectual Property Right</h3>
  
Intellectual property rights are the legal rights that cover the privileges given to individuals who are the owners and inventors of a work, and have created something with their intellectual creativity. Individuals related to areas such as literature, music, invention, etc., can be granted such rights, which can then be used in the business practices by them. <br>

The creator/inventor gets exclusive rights against any misuse or use of work without his/her prior information. However, the rights are granted for a limited period of time to maintain equilibrium.

The following list of activities which are covered by the intellectual property rights are laid down by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) - <br>

Industrial designs <br>
Scientific discoveries <br>
Protection against unfair competition <br>
Literary, artistic, and scientific works <br>
Inventions in all fields of human endeavor <br>
Performances of performing artists, phonograms, and broadcasts <br>
Trademarks, service marks, commercial names, and designations <br>
All other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary, or artistic fields <br>    

<h2>Types of Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
Intellectual Property Rights can be further classified into the following categories - <br>

Copyright <br>
Patent <br>
Patent <br>
Trade Secrets, etc. <br>

<h2>Advantages of Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
Intellectual property rights are advantageous in the following ways - <br>

Provides exclusive rights to the creators or inventors. <br>

Encourages individuals to distribute and share information and data instead of keeping it confidential. <br>

Provides legal defense and offers the creators the incentive of their work. <br>

Helps in social and financial development. <br>

<h2>Intellectual Property Rights in India</h2>
To protect the intellectual property rights in the Indian territory, India has defined the formation of constitutional, administrative and jurisdictive outline whether they imply the copyright, patent, trademark, industrial designs, or any other parts of the intellectual property rights. <br>

Back in the year 1999, the government passed an important legislation based on international practices to safeguard the intellectual property rights. Let us have a glimpse of the same -  <br>

The Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999, facilitates the establishment of the mail box system for filing patents. It offers exclusive marketing rights for a time period of five years. <br>

The Trade Marks Bill, 1999, replaced the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 <br>

The Copyright (Amendment) Act, 1999, was signed by the President of India. <br>

The sui generis legislation was approved and named as the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Bill, 1999. <br>

The Industrial Designs Bill, 1999, replaced the Designs Act, 1911. <br>

The Patents (Second Amendment) Bill, 1999, for further amending the Patents Act of 1970 in compliance with the TRIPS. <br>

<h2>Intellectual Property in Cyber Space</h2>
Every new invention in the field of technology experiences a variety of threats. Internet is one such threat, which has captured the physical marketplace and have converted it into a virtual marketplace. <br>

To safeguard the business interest, it is vital to create an effective property management and protection mechanism keeping in mind the considerable amount of business and commerce taking place in the Cyber Space. <br>

Today it is critical for every business to develop an effective and collaborative IP management mechanism and protection strategy. The ever-looming threats in the cybernetic world can thus be monitored and confined. <br>

Various approaches and legislations have been designed by the law-makers to up the ante in delivering a secure configuration against such cyber-threats. However it is the duty of the intellectual property right (IPR) owner to invalidate and reduce such mala fide acts of criminals by taking proactive measures. <br>



<h3>1. What is Cybercrime?</h3>
