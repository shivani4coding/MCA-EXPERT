    				     <h1>Interview Question</h1>

<h2>1) What is JIT compiler?</h2>

<p>Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler:It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the byte code that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation.Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.</p>

<h2>2) What is platform?</h2>

<p>A platform is basically the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides software-based platform.</p>

<h2>3) What is the main difference between Java platform and other platforms?</h2>

The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it's a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.It has two components: <br>

1.Runtime Environment <br>
2.API(Application Programming Interface) <br>

<h2>4) What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?</h2>

<p>The bytecode. Java is compiled to be a byte code which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This byte code is not platform specific and hence can be fed to any platform.</p>

<h2>5) What is this in java?</h2>

It is a keyword that that refers to the current object.more details...

<h2>6)What is Inheritance?</h2>

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of another object of another class. It represents IS-A relationship. It is used for Code Resusability and Method Overriding.

<h2>7) Which class is the superclass for every class.</h2>

Object class.

<h2>8) Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?</h2>

To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java in case of class.

<h2>9) Why Java does not support pointers?</h2>

Pointer is a variable that refers to the memory address. They are not used in java because they are unsafe(unsecured) and complex to understand.

<h2>10) What is super in java?</h2>
	It is a keyword that refers to the immediate parent class object.

<h2>11) How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?</h2>

Many types: <br>
1.Class(Method) Area <br>
2.Heap <br>
3.Stack <br>
4.Program Counter Register <br>
5.Native Method Stack <br>
