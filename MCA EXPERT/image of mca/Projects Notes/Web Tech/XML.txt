				XML

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a text-based markup language derived from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).This tutorial will teach you basics of XML. The tutorial is divided into sections such as XML Basics, Advanced XML and XML tools.

XML tags identify the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display the data. XML is not going to replace HTML in the near future, but it introduces new possibilities by adopting many successful features of HTML.

There are three important characteristics of XML that make it useful in a variety of systems and solutions:
1.XML is extensible: XML allows you to create your own self-descriptive tags, or language, that suits your application.

2.XML carries the data, does not present it: XML allows you to store the data irrespective of how it will be presented.

3.XML is a public standard: XML was developed by an organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is available as an open standard.
