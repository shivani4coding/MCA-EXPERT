				AJAX 

AJAX, is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications.If you know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and XML, then you need to spend just one hour to start with AJAX.

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

Ajax uses XHTML for content, CSS for presentation, along with Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.

Conventional web applications transmit information to and from the server using synchronous requests. It means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.


AJAX cannot work independently. It is used in combination with other technologies to create interactive webpages.

			CSS

		XMLHttpRequest
