				Javascript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.


		JavaScript - Syntax

JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

<script ...>
   JavaScript code
</script>


			JavaScript - Variables

   JavaScript Datatypes

One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.

JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types -
1.Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.

2.Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.

3.Boolean e.g. true or false.


		JavaScript - Operators

What is an operator?

Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

1.Arithmetic Operators

2.Comparision Operators

3.Logical (or Relational) Operators

4.Assignment Operators

5.Conditional (or ternary) Operators


		JavaScript - if...else Statement

JavaScript supports the following forms of if..else statement -

1.if statement

	Example of if statement-

<html>
   <body>
      
      <script type="text/javascript">
         <!--
            var age = 20;
         
            if( age > 18 ){
               document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>");
            }
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
   </body>
</html>

2.if...else statement

      Example of if...else statement-

if (expression){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

else{
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
}

3.if...else if... statement.

       Example of if...else if... statement.

<html>
   <body>
   
      <script type="text/javascript">
         <!--
            var age = 15;
         
            if( age > 18 ){
               document.write("<b>Qualifies for driving</b>");
            }
            
            else{
               document.write("<b>Does not qualify for driving</b>");
            }
         //-->
      </script>
      
      <p>Set the variable to different value and then try...</p>
   </body>
</html>

4.if...else if... statement

if (expression 1){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
}

else if (expression 2){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
}

else if (expression 3){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
}

else{
   Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
}



		JavaScript - The Strings Object

The String object lets you work with a series of characters; it wraps Javascript's string primitive data type with a number of helper methods.As JavaScript automatically converts between string primitives and String objects, you can call any of the helper methods of the String object on a string primitive.

    Syntax of string in javascript-
	var val = new String(string);

	
		JavaScript - Document Object Model or DOM

A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window. The Document object has various properties that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of document content.The way a document content is accessed and modified is called the Document Object Model, or DOM. The Objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of objects in a Web document.

1.Window object - Top of the hierarchy. It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy.

2.Document object - Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page.

3.Form object - Everything enclosed in the <form>...</form> tags sets the form object.

4.Form control elements - The form object contains all the elements defined for that object such as text fields, buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
